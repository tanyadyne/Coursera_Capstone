# Situation
New homeowners often take into consideration a wide range of factors when choosing where they would like to permanently reside. And families (especially those with children) often prioritise safety above all things. Beyond that, different households will also vary in terms of what they do in their free time or how they commute to work. As such, some demographics will appreciate neighborhoods with well-connected public transport, some will appreciate having many grocery shops in the vicinity, and others will prefer having plenty of clubs and restaurants to choose from.

# Task
This project is my "Applied Data Science Specialisation" Capstone completed as part of the IBM Data Science course on Coursera. Given the situation outlined above, it aims to:
a) identify the 'safest' borough in London based on crime rate
b) explore/characterise the neighborhoods within that borough (i.e. determine the most common venues in each neighborhood)
c) cluster/group those neighborhoods using k-means clustering.

# Things I learnt from this project
As this project was my first 'major' experience with python, I learnt a lot about how to write readable code, how to use jupyter notebooks, and how to approach a problem using python. Of course, I also gained experience using various python packages such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib and folium, among others.
