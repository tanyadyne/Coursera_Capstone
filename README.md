# What is this project?
This project is my "Applied Data Science Specialisation" Capstone completed as part of the IBM Data Science course on Coursera. It aims to:
a) identify the 'safest' borough in London based on crime rate
b) explore the neighborhoods within that borough (i.e. determine the most common venues in each neighborhood)
c) cluster/group those neighborhoods using k-means clustering.

# Why is this project useful?
I aim to derive some use from this project based on the notion that families (with children) looking for a new house often prioritise safety above all things. The results from this project may then be used to advise these families/customers on which London borough is the safest, and by extension, which neighborhood within that borough may suit them best based on their lifestyles (e.g. do they frequent restaurants often, do they require public transport?). Although my original target audience was families (particularly those with children), I acknowledge that the results can be used by anyone looking for additional information on the safety of London boroughs.

# Things I learnt from this project
As this project was my first 'major' experience with python, I learnt a lot about how to write readable code, how to use jupyter notebooks, and how to approach a problem using python. Of course, I also gained experience using various python packages such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib and folium, among others.
