    "The data for this project will be acquired from three sources (links to all three can be found at the end of this section). Firstly, the project will utilise a crime dataset which counts the number of crimes in each London borough, per month, (from May 2018 - April 2020), according to crime type. The dataset contains the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **MajorText**: The higher-level/general categorisation of the crime\n",
    " - **MinorText**: The lower-level/specific categorisation of the crime (within the MajorText category)\n",
    " - **LookUp_BoroughName**: The common name for the London borough\n",
    " - **Year and month (multiple columns)**: Monthly reported count of each crime type in given borough\n",
    "\n",
    "The second source of data will be scraped from a wikipedia page that contains the list of London boroughs. It contains the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Borough**: The name of the London borough\n",
    " - **Inner**: Categorization of either an inner or outer London borough\n",
    " - **Status**: Categorization of a Royal, City, or other borough\n",
    " - **Local authority**: The local authority assigned to the borough\n",
    " - **Political control**: The political party that controls the borough\n",
    " - **Headquarters**: Location of the borough's headquarters\n",
    " - **Area (sq mi)**: Area of the borough in square miles\n",
    " - **Population (2013 est)**: The population of the borough recorded in 2013\n",
    " - **Coordinates**: The latitude and longitude of the borough\n",
    " - **Nr. in map**: The number assigned to each borough to represent visually on a map\n",
    "\n",
    "The third data source is the list of nieghborhoods in the borough of 'Richmond upon Thames' as found on wikipedia. The dataset will be manually created from scratch and will include the following columns:\n",

    " - **Neighborhood**: Name of the neighborhood in the borough\n",
    " - **Borough**: Name of the borough\n",
    " - **Latitude**: Latitude of the neighborhood\n",

We will produce two dataframes here: one that shows both the major and minor crimes, as well as one that shows the total crimes for each borough:\n",

As such, we will drop the unnecesary columns and remove any unwanted extra text.\n",
